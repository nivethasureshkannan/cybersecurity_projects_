# Professional Statement

I’m Nivetha Sureshkannan, currently pursuing my M.Tech in Cybersecurity Systems and Networks , after completing my Bachelor’s in Computer Science. During my one-year apprenticeship as a SOC Analyst at the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) Data Center in Hyderabad, I had the chance to learn from real-world experiences, working with tools like ArcSight SIEM, HCL AppScan, and Trend Micro Deep Discovery Analyzer. I was involved in monitoring security events, assisting with vulnerability assessments, and supporting network security operations, which helped me grow professionally.

I’ve also tried to expand my skills by taking courses in Python, data science, and SQL. Outside of academics, I served as the Director of District Priority Projects in Texcity Rotaract, where I had the privilege of working with a dedicated team to contribute to various community projects.

My goal is to have a wide range of knowledge as a generalist with the specialized skills of a red teamer. I’m currently preparing for the `Hack The Box Certified Penetration Tester (HTB CPTS) certification` to strengthen my expertise in offensive security and take the next step in my cybersecurity journey.
